# DID-Blockchain-Project 

## Description
This project aims to implement Decentralized Identification (DID) using smart contracts. DID is a modern approach to identity management that removes the need for centralized authorities, empowering users with greater privacy, security, and control over their personal information.

The DID Project provides a secure framework for:

- Storing decentralized identities on the blockchain

- Allowing institutions to issue verifiable credentials to DID holders

- Enhancing transparency and trust between users and credential issuers

This solution can be the foundation for secure and privacy-respecting decentralized identity 

## Architecture 
The architecture of this project was inspired from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/Faizack/Supply-Chain-Blockchain?tab=readme-ov-file) from Faizack about supply chain in
blockchain. The smart contract is written in solidity (```.sol```) and it is compiled, migrated and after deployed with Truffle.js
on a Ganache blockchain test network. The front end is in Web3.js and communicates with the test network by connecting the wallets with Meta Mask
wallet. Here is an image to illustrate the process that was also taken by the repository above :
