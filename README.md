# DID-Blockchain-Project 

## Description
This project aims to implement Decentralized Identification (DID) using smart contracts. DID is a modern approach to identity management that removes the need for centralized authorities, empowering users with greater privacy, security, and control over their personal information.

The DID Project provides a secure framework for:

    - Storing decentralized identities on the blockchain

    - Allowing institutions to issue verifiable credentials to DID holders

    - Enhancing transparency and trust between users and credential issuers

This solution can be the foundation for secure and privacy-respecting decentralized identity 

## Architecture 
The architecture of this project was inspired from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/Faizack/Supply-Chain-Blockchain?tab=readme-ov-file).
